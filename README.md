# cfrnet
Counterfactual Regression using Balancing Neural Networks as developed by Johansson, Shalit & Sontag (2016) and Shalit, Johansson & Sontag (2016).

cfrnet is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and NumPy.

# Code

The core components of cfrnet, i.e. the TensorFlow graph, is contained in cfr_net.py.
A simple training script is contained in cfr_train_simple.py. 

# Examples

In the root directory there is an example script called run_simple.sh which calls the python script cfr_train_simple.py. This example trains a counterfactual regression model on a single realization of the simulated IHDP data (see references), contained in data/ihdp_sample.csv. It creates a folder called results/single_\<config & timestamp\>/ which contains 5 files: 

* config.txt - The configuration used for the run
* log.txt - A log file
* loss.csv - The objective, factual, counterfactual and imbalance losses over time
* y_pred.csv - The predicted factual and counterfactual outputs for all units)
* results.npz - A numpy array file with the fields "pred" and "loss" which contains the same output as the previous two files.
